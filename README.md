# MTASA ASE BYTECODE TO JSON IN PYTHON
The program intended to download MTA ASE bytecode and convert to JSON format in python.

This repo is a version of Tederis's ase2json repo. The motivation behind this was that i don't really know C++, and i plan to work with this data later so it made sense to translate his work into Python.
